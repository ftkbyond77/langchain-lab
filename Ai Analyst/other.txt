Set PYTHONUTF8 Environment Variable (Windows):
Before running the script, set the environment variable to enable UTF-8 encoding:

``` 
    set PYTHONUTF8=1
    python fraud_detection_system.py

```

To make it persistent:

```
    setx PYTHONUTF8 1
```

1. AI Agent System Development
Multi-Agent Collaboration AI Agent:
Add a team of AI Agents working together with divided responsibilities, such as:
- Data Analyst Agent: Analyzes insights and summarizes patterns
- Risk Scoring Agent: Provides risk scores based on real-time data
- Alert Generation Agent: Creates alerts when suspicious transactions are detected
- Recommendation Agent: Suggests fraud prevention methods based on discovered patterns
Use LangChain or CrewAI to enable these Agents to communicate and make joint decisions—for example, one Agent flags a transaction and passes it to others for further analysis.
==============================
Context-Aware AI Agent:
- Upgrade the Agent’s memory (from ConversationBufferMemory) to store long-term context, such as each customer’s fraud history or seasonally changing patterns
- Add the ability to learn from frequently asked user questions to improve accuracy and relevance of responses
Explainable AI (XAI) Integration:
- Add the capability for AI Agents to explain why the Machine Learning model judged a transaction as fraudulent, using XAI techniques like SHAP or LIME
- Example: When a user asks “Why was this transaction flagged?”, the Agent can respond, “This transaction has an unusually high amount and occurred at an unusual time for this user.”

2. Enhancing Fraud Detection Efficiency
Real-Time Fraud Scoring API:
- Develop an API that provides real-time risk scores for new transactions, where AI Agents call the ML model and send back risk scores to other systems (e.g., banking systems)
- Example: The Agent receives new transaction data (e.g., amount, type, time) and responds with a risk score (0-100)
Graph-Based Fraud Detection:
- Create an Agent that analyzes relationship graphs between accounts, recipients, and transactions to detect fraud networks (e.g., Money Laundering)
- Use Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and have the Agent explain patterns like, “This account is connected to 3 suspicious accounts.”
